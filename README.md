Large scale resturants require many moving parts to keep operations running smoothly. A large aspect of that involves supply chain relationships, and inventory management. And while they seem interconnected they, being able to function together often can prove to be challenging. We aspire to create a website that allows large scale resturant operators (managaers, franchisees, etc.) be front and center in their inventory management and be involved in the supply chain. Our website **restoq** creates a user-friendly space for operators to keep track of inventory, make data-driven decisions based on historical ordering data, and connect directly with suppliers to order and communicate their needs. 

Through our website, operators are able to view their historical data on the dashboard and make informed descisions regarding order quantity, using this feature allows large scale restuants to activly attempt to reduce food waste. Operators will have access to metrics such as: Category, Stock, Price/Unit, Daily Use, Days Left, Shelf Life Status, and Recommended Order for each item that they stock, which can be filtered by restock urgency such as: Critical, Low Stock and Healthy. This feature makes it easier for operators to quickly identify items that require immediate attention. Additionally, operators can navigate between tabs including Dashboard, Suppliers, Messages, Emails, and Licenses for each restaurant chain, allowing for streamlined inventory management and communication across locations.
